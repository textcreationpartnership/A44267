            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head type="sub">CONCERNING The VERTUES of an HEROIQUE POEM.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Vertues required in an Heroick Poem (and indeed in all Writings publiſhed) are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended all in this one word <hi>Diſcretion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Diſcretion conſiſteth in this, That every part of the Poem be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing, and in good order placed to the end and deſigne of the Poet. And the Deſigne is not only to profit, but alſo to delight the Reader.</p>
            <p>By Profit, I intend not here any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Wealth either to the Poet, or to the Reader; but acceſſion of Prudence, Juſtice, and Fortitude, by the Example of ſuch Great and Noble
<pb facs="tcp:106842:4"/>Perſons as he introduceth ſpeaking, or deſcribeth acting. For all men love to behold, though not to practiſe Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. So that at laſt the work of an Heroique Poet is no more but to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh an ingenuous Reader (when his leiſure abounds) with the diverſion of an honeſt and delightful Story, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther true or feigned.</p>
            <p>But becauſe there be many men cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Critiques, and Wits, and Vertuoſi, that are accuſtomed to cenſure the Poets, and moſt of them of divers Judgements: How is it poſſible (you'll ſay) to pleaſe them all? Yes, very well; if the Poem be as it ſhould be. For men can judge what's good, that know not what is beſt. For he that can judge what is beſt, muſt have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered all thoſe things (though they be almoſt innumerable) that concur to make the reading of an Heroique Poem pleaſant. Whereof I'll name as many as ſhall come into my mind.</p>
            <p>And they are contained, firſt, in the choice of Words. Secondly, in
<pb facs="tcp:106842:4"/>the Conſtruction. Thirdly, in the Contrivance of the Story or Fiction. Fourthly, in the Elevation of the Fancie. Fifthly, in the Juſtice and Impartiality of the Poet. Sixthly, in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> clearneſs of Deſcriptions. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venthly, in the Amplitude of the Subject.</p>
            <p>And (to begin with words) the firſt Indiſcretion is, The uſe of ſuch words as to the Readers of Poeſie (which are commonly Perſons of the beſt Quality) are not ſufficiently known. For the work of an Heroick Poem is to raiſe admiration (princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally) for three Vertues, Valour, Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Love; to the reading whereof Women no leſs than Men have a juſt pretence, though their ſkill in Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage be not ſo univerſal. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore forein words till by long uſe they become vulgar, are unintelligible to them. Alſo the names of Inſtruments and Tools of Artificers, and words of Art, though of uſe in the Schools, are far from being fit to be ſpoken by a
<pb facs="tcp:106842:5"/>Heroe. He may delight in the Arts themſelves, and have ſkill in ſome of them; but his Glory lies not in that, but in Courage, Nobility, and other Vertues of Nature, or in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand he has over other men. Nor does <hi>Homer</hi> in any part of his Poem attribute any praiſe to <hi>Achilles,</hi> or any blame to <hi>Alexander,</hi> for that they had both learnt to play upon the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hittarre. The Character of words that become a Heroe are Property, and Significan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, but without both the malice and laſciviouſneſs of a Satyr.</p>
            <p>Another Vertue of an Heroique Poem is the Perſpicuity and the Faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Conſtruction, and conſiſteth in a natural contexture of the words, ſo as not to diſcover the labour but the natural ability of the Poet; and this is uſually called a good Style. For the order of words when placed as they ought to be, carries a light before it, whereby a man may foreſee the length of his period; as a torch in the night ſhews a man the ſtops and uneveneſs in
<pb facs="tcp:106842:5"/>his way. But when plac'd unnaturally, the Reader will often find unexpected checks, and be forced to go back and hunt for the ſenſe, and ſuffer ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, as in a Coach a man unexpectedly finds in paſſing over a furrow. And though the Laws of Verſe (which have bound the Greeks and Latines to number of Feet, and quantity of Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lables, and the Engliſh and other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to number of Syllables and Rime) put great conſtraint upon the natural courſe of Language; yet the Poet, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the liberty to depart from what is obſtinate, and to chuſe ſomewhat elſe that is more obedient to ſuch Laws, and no leſs fit for his purpoſe, ſhall not be (neither by the meaſure, nor by the neceſſity of Rime) excuſed; though a Tranſlation often may.</p>
            <p>A third Vertue lies in the Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance. For there is difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a Poem and a Hiſtory in Proſe. For a Hiſtory is wholly related by the Writer; but in a Heroique Poem the Narration is, a great part of it, put
<pb facs="tcp:106842:6"/>upon ſome of the perſons introduced by the Poet. So <hi>Homer</hi> begins not his <hi>Iliad</hi> with the injury done by <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> but makes it related by <hi>Menelaus,</hi> and very briefly as a thing notorious; nor begins he his <hi>Odyſſes</hi> with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> from <hi>Troy,</hi> but makes <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> himſelf relate the ſame to <hi>Alcinous,</hi> in the midſt of his Poem; which I think much more pleaſant and ingenious, than a too preciſe and cloſe following of the time.</p>
            <p>A fourth is in the Elevation of Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, which is generally taken for the greateſt praiſe of Heroick Poetry; and is ſo, when governed by diſcretion. For men more generally affect and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire Fancy than they do either Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or Reaſon, or Memory, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther intellectual Vertue, and for the pleaſantneſs of it, give to it alone the name of Wit, accounting Reaſon and Judgment but for a dull entertainment. For in Fancy conſiſteth the Sublimity of a Poet, which is that Poetical Fury which the Readers for the moſt part
<pb facs="tcp:106842:6"/>call for. It flies abroad ſwiftly to fetch in both Matter and Words; but if there be not Diſcretion at home to diſtinguiſh which are fit to be uſed and which not, which decent, and which undecent for Perſons, Times, and Places, their delight and grace is loſt. But if they be diſcreetly uſed, they are greater ornaments of a Poem by much than any other. A Metaphor alſo (which is a Compariſon contracted into a word) is not unpleaſant; but when they are ſharp, and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, they are not fit for an Heroick Poet, nor for a publick conſultation, but only for an Accuſation or Defence at the Bar.</p>
            <p>A fifth lies in the Juſtice and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiality of the Poet, and belongeth as well to Hiſtory as to Poetry. For both the Poet and the Hiſtorian wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth only (or ſhould do) matter of Fact. And as far as the truth of Fact can defame a man, ſo far they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to blemiſh the reputation of perſons. But to do the ſame upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
<pb facs="tcp:106842:7"/>or by inference, is below the dignity not onely of a Heroe but of a Man. For neither a Poet nor an Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian ought to make himſelf an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Maſter of any mans good name. None of the Emperors of <hi>Rome</hi> whom <hi>Tacitus</hi> or any other Writer hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, was ever ſubject to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any of them, nor were they ever heard to plead for themſelves, which are things that ought to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent to condemnation. Nor was (I think) <hi>Epicurus</hi> the Philoſopher (who is tranſmitted to us by the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icks for a man of evil and voluptuous life) ever called, convented, and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully convicted, as all men ought to be before they be defamed. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis a very great fault in a Poet to ſpeak evil of any man in their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings Hiſtorical.</p>
            <p>A ſixth Vertue conſiſts in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and curioſity of Deſcriptions, which the ancient Writers of Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence call <hi>Icones,</hi> that is <hi>Images.</hi> And an Image is always a part, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:106842:7"/>the ground of a Poetical compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon. As (for example) when <hi>Virgil</hi> would ſet before our eyes the fall of <hi>Troy,</hi> he deſcribes perhaps the whole Labour of many men together in the felling of ſome great Tree, and with how much ado it fell. This is the Image. To which if you but add theſe words, So fell <hi>Troy,</hi> you have the Compariſon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire; the grace whereof lieth in the lightſomneſs, and is but the deſcription of all (even of the minuteſt) parts of the thing deſcribed; that not onely they that ſtand far off, but alſo they that ſtand neer, and look upon it with the oldeſt ſpectacles of a Critick, may approve it. For a Poet is a Painter, and ſhould paint Actions to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding with the moſt decent words, as Painters do Perſons and Bodies with the choiceſt colours, to the eye; which if not done nicely, will not be worthy to be plac'd in a Cabinet.</p>
            <p>The ſeventh Vertue which lying in the amplitude of the Subject, is nothing but variety, and a thing without which
<pb facs="tcp:106842:8"/>a whole Poem would be no pleaſanter than an Epigram, or one good Verſe; nor a Picture of a hundred figures better than any one of them aſunder, if drawn with equal art. And theſe are the Vertues which ought eſpecially to be looked upon by the Criticks, in the comparing of the Poets, <hi>Homer</hi> with <hi>Virgil,</hi> or <hi>Virgil</hi> with <hi>Lucan.</hi> For theſe only, for their excellency, I have read or heard compared.</p>
            <p>If the compariſon be grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the firſt and ſecond Vertues, which conſiſt in known words and Style un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forc'd, they are all excellent in their own Language, though perhaps the Latine than the Greek is apter to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it ſelf into an Hexameter Verſe, as having both fewer Monoſyllables and fewer Polyſyllables. And this may make the Latin Verſe appear more grave and equal, which is taken for a kinde of Majeſty; though in truth there be no Majeſty in words, but then when they ſeem to proceed from an high and weighty employment of the
<pb facs="tcp:106842:8"/>minde. But neither <hi>Homer,</hi> nor <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil,</hi> nor <hi>Lucan,</hi> nor any Poet writing commendably (though not excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) was ever charged much with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known words, or great conſtraint of Style, as being a fault proper to Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlators, when they hold themſelves too ſuperſtitiouſly to their Authors words.</p>
            <p>In the third Vertue, which is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance, there is no doubt but <hi>Homer</hi> excels them all. For their Poems (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Introduction of their Gods) are but ſo many Hiſtories in Verſe; where <hi>Homer</hi> has woven ſo many Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories together as contain the whole Learning of his time (which the Greeks call <hi>Cyclopaedia</hi>) and furniſhed both the Greek and Latin Stages with all the Plots and Arguments of their Tragedies.</p>
            <p>The fourth Vertue, which is the height of Fancy, is almoſt proper to <hi>Lucan,</hi> and ſo admirable in him, that no Heroique Poem raiſes ſuch admiration of the Poet, as his hath done, though
<pb facs="tcp:106842:9"/>not ſo great admiration of the perſons he introduceth. And though it be a mark of a great Wit; yet it is fitter for a Rhetorician than a Poet, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belleth often againſt Diſcretion; as when he ſays
<q>Victrix cauſa Diis placuit, ſed victa Catoni.</q>
that is,
<q>
                  <l>The Side that Won the Gods approved moſt,</l>
                  <l>But <hi>Cato</hi> better lik'd the Side that loſt.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Than which nothing could be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken more gloriouſly to the Exaltation of a man, nor more diſgracefully to the Depreſſion of the Gods. <hi>Homer</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed maketh ſome Gods for the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and ſome for the <hi>Trojans;</hi> but always makes <hi>Jupiter</hi> impartial. And never prefers the judgement of a Man before that of <hi>Jupiter;</hi> much leſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the judgement of all the Gods together.</p>
            <p>The fifth Vertue, which is the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Impartiality of a Poet, is
<pb facs="tcp:106842:9"/>very eminent in <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi> but the contrary in <hi>Lucan. Lucan</hi> ſhews himſelf openly in the <hi>Pompeyan</hi> Faction, inveighing againſt <hi>Caeſar</hi> throughout his Poem, like <hi>Cicero</hi> againſt <hi>Cataline</hi> or <hi>Marc Antony;</hi> and is therefore juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reckon'd by <hi>Quintilian</hi> as a Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torician rather than a Poet. And a great part of the delight of his Readers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from the pleaſure which too many men take to hear Great perſons cenſured. But <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially <hi>Homer</hi>) do every where what they can to preſerve the Reputation of their Heroes.</p>
            <p>If we compare <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> by the ſixth Vertue, which is the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Images (or Deſcriptions) it is manifeſt that <hi>Homer</hi> ought to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd, though <hi>Virgil</hi> himſelf were to be the Judge. For there are very few Images in <hi>Virgil</hi> beſides thoſe which he hath tranſlated out of <hi>Homer;</hi> ſo that <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Images are <hi>Homer</hi>'s Praiſes. But what if he have added ſomething to it of his own? Though he have, yet
<pb facs="tcp:106842:10"/>it is no addition of praiſe, becauſe 'tis eaſie. But he hath ſome Images which are not in <hi>Homer,</hi> and better than his. It may be ſo, and ſo may other Poets have which never durſt compare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with <hi>Homer.</hi> Two or three fine ſayings are not enough to make a Wit. But where is that Image of his better done by him than <hi>Homer,</hi> of thoſe that have been done by them both? Yes, <hi>Euſtathius</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Ogilby</hi> hath obſerv'd) where they both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the falling of a Tree, prefers <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil</hi>'s deſcription. But <hi>Euſtathius</hi> is in that, I think, miſtaken. The place of <hi>Homer</hi> is in the fourth of the <hi>Iliads,</hi> the ſenſe whereof is this:
<q>
                  <l>As when a man hath fell'd a Poplar Tree</l>
                  <l>Tall, ſtreight, and ſmooth, with all the fair boughs on;</l>
                  <l>Of which he means a Coach-wheel made ſhall be,</l>
                  <l>And leaves it on the Bank to dry i'th' Sun:</l>
                  <l>So lay the comely <hi>Simoiſius,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Slain by great <hi>Ajax,</hi> Son of <hi>Telamon.</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>It is mauifeſt that in this place <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:106842:10"/>intended no more than to ſhew how comely the body of <hi>Simoiſius</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared as he lay dead upon the Bank of <hi>Scamander,</hi> ſtreight, and tall, with a fair head of hair, and like a ſtreight and high Poplar with the boughs ſtill on; and not at all to deſcribe the manner of his falling, which (when a man is wounded through the breaſt, as he was with a Spear) is always ſudden.</p>
            <p>The deſcription of how a great Tree falleth, when many men together hew it down, is in the ſecond of <hi>Virgil</hi>'s <hi>Aeneads.</hi> The ſenſe of it, with the compariſon, is in Engliſh this:
<q>
                  <l>And <hi>Troy,</hi> methought, then ſunk in fire and ſmoke,</l>
                  <l>And overturned was in every part:</l>
                  <l>As when upon the mountain an old Oak</l>
                  <l>Is he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>en about with keen ſteel to the heart,</l>
                  <l>And pli'd by Swains with many heavy blows,</l>
                  <l>It nods and every way it threatens round,</l>
                  <l>Till overcome with many wounds it bows,</l>
                  <l>And leiſurely at laſt comes to the ground.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And here again it is evident that <hi>Virgil</hi> meant to compare the manner
<pb facs="tcp:106842:11"/>how <hi>Troy</hi> after many Battles, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the loſſes of many Cities, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd by the many Nations under <hi>Agememnon</hi> in a long War, and thereby weak'ned, and at laſt overthrown, with a great Tree hewn round about, and then falling by little and little leiſurely.</p>
            <p>So that neither theſe two Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, nor the two Compariſons can be compared together. The Image of a man lying on the ground is one thing; the Image of falling (eſpecially of a Kingdom) is another. This therefore gives no advantage to <hi>Virgil</hi> over <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</hi> 'Tis true, that this Deſcription of the Felling and Falling of a Tree is exceeding graceful. But is it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore more than <hi>Homer</hi> could have done if need had been? Or is there no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription in <hi>Homer</hi> of ſomewhat elſe as good as this? Yes, and in many of our Engliſh Poets now alive. If it then be lawful for <hi>Julius Scaliger</hi> to ſay, that if <hi>Jupiter</hi> would have deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed the fall of a Tree, he could not
<pb facs="tcp:106842:11"/>have mended this of <hi>Virgil;</hi> it will be lawful for me to repeat an old Epigram of <hi>Antipater,</hi> to the like purpoſe, in favour of <hi>Homer.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <l>The Writer of the famous <hi>Trojan</hi> War,</l>
               <l>And of <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> Life, O <hi>Jove</hi> make known,</l>
               <l>Who whence he was; for thine the Verſes are,</l>
               <l>And he would have us think they are his own.</l>
            </q>
            <p>The ſeventh and laſt commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of an Heroick Poem conſiſteth in Amplitude and Variety; and in this <hi>Homer</hi> exceedeth <hi>Virgil</hi> very much, and that not by ſuperfluity of words, but by plenty of Heroick matter, and multitude of Deſcriptions and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſons (whereof <hi>Virgil</hi> hath tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but a ſmall part into his <hi>Aeneads</hi>) ſuch as are the Images of Shipwracks, Battles, Single Combats, Beauty, Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the mind, Sacrifices, Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and other things, whereof <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil</hi> (abating what he borrows of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>) has ſcarce the twentieth part. It is no wonder therefore if all the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Learned men both of <hi>Greece</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:106842:12"/>
               <hi>Rome</hi> having given the firſt place in Poetry to <hi>Homer.</hi> It is rather ſtrange that two or three, and of late time, and but Learners of the Greek tongue, ſhould dare to contradict ſo many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Judges, both of Language and Diſcretion. But howſoever I defend <hi>Homer,</hi> I aim not thereby at any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection upon the following Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Why then did I write it? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I had nothing elſe to do. Why publiſh it? Becauſe I thought it might take off my Adverſaries from ſhewing their folly upon my more ſerious Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and ſet them upon my Verſes to ſhew their wiſdom. But why without Annotations? Becauſe I had no hope to do it better than it is already done by Mr. <hi>Ogilby.</hi>

                     <l>And laſt of all a Spear takes in his hand.</l>
                     <l>And in like Armour <hi>Menelaus</hi> ſtood.</l>
                     <l>Then come they forth, and in the Liſts they ſtand.</l>
                     <l>And one did on another fiercely look.</l>
                     <l>(The people ſtupid ſat 'twixt hope and fear.)</l>
                     <l>And when they come were nigh, their Spears they ſhook.</l>
                     <l>But <hi>Paris</hi> was the firſt to throw his Spear,</l>
                     <l>And threw, and ſmote the Shield of <hi>Menelaus,</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>But through the Mettle tough it paſſed not,</l>
                     <l>But turn'd, and bended at the point it was.</l>
                     <l>Then <hi>Menelaus</hi> was to throw by Lot.</l>
                     <l>But firſt he prayed. Grant me, O <hi>Jove,</hi> (ſaid he)</l>
                     <l>That this my Spear may <hi>Alexander</hi> ſlay,</l>
                     <l>Who was the firſt that did the injury.</l>
                     <l>That they who ſhall be born hereafter may</l>
                     <l>Not dare to violate the Sacred Laws</l>
                     <l>Of Hoſpitality. Having thus ſaid,</l>
                     <l>He threw his Spear, which <hi>Paris</hi> Shield did paſs,</l>
                     <l>And through his Breaſt-plate quite, and there it ſtaid;</l>
                     <l>But tore his Coat. And there he had been dead,</l>
                     <l>But that his Belly ſomewhat he drew back.</l>
                     <l>Then with his Sword <hi>Atrides</hi> ſmote his head</l>
                     <l>Which arm'd was, and the Sword in pieces broke.</l>
                     <l>Then <hi>Menelaus</hi> grieved at the heart,</l>
                     <l>Looking to Heaven did on <hi>Jove</hi> complain.</l>
                     <l>O <hi>Jove</hi> that of the Gods moſt cruel art,</l>
                     <l>Broken my Sword, my Spear is thrown in vain.</l>
                     <l>Then ſuddenly laid hold on <hi>Paris</hi> Creſt,</l>
                     <l>And to the <hi>Greeks</hi> to drag him did begin,</l>
                     <l>And <hi>Paris</hi> then was mightily diſtreſt,</l>
                     <l>Choakt by the Latchet underneath his Chin.</l>

                     <l>Or (now I think on't) plain and openly.</l>
                     <l>For I ſee nothing that I need to fear.</l>
                     <l>I am not forc'd to fight unwillingly,</l>
                     <l>Nor raſhly undertook the enterprize.</l>
                     <l>For I was born and bred in <hi>Salamis,</hi>

                     <l>He walkt away with a Majeſtique pace,</l>
                     <l>As <hi>Mars</hi> goes to the War. His ſtrides were great,</l>

                     <l>And as he went he ſhook his mighty Spear,</l>

                     <l>But by the <hi>Trojans</hi> lookt on was with fear;</l>
                     <l>And <hi>Hector</hi> at the heart himſelf was cold.</l>
                     <l>But was aſhamed back again to fly,</l>
                     <l>Since he provok'd him had into the field.</l>
                     <l>And <hi>Ajax</hi> now was come unto him nigh,</l>
                     <l>As from a Tower looking ore his Shield.</l>

                     <l>That in the Army many yet remain,</l>

                     <l>
                        <hi>Ajax</hi> (ſaid <hi>Hector</hi>) I am not a Child</l>

                     <l>That underſtands the bus'neſs of the Field,</l>
                     <l>And can my Buckler bear from Left to Right,</l>
                     <l>And have whereon in Battle to rely,</l>
                     <l>And how to guide my Horſes in a fight,</l>

                     <l>And at that word the long Spear from him flew,</l>

                     <l>But there it ſtaid. Then <hi>Ajax</hi> threw his Spear,</l>

                     <l>For elſe it pierced had his Belly too.</l>
                     <l>Then from their Shields the Spears they plucked out,</l>
                     <l>And them no more at one another threw,</l>
                     <l>But came unto each other cloſe and fought.</l>
                     <l>And like two Lions on each other flew.</l>

                     <l>Which entred not, reſiſted by the braſs:</l>
                     <l>But <hi>Hector</hi>'s Shield to <hi>Ajax</hi> Spear did yield,</l>
                     <l>Which pierc'd it through; and ſo far in did paſs,</l>
                     <l>That grazing on his Neck it fetch'd the blood.</l>
                     <l>But <hi>Hector</hi> not diſmaid took up a Stone.</l>
                     <l>

                     <l>When they had burnt them, back they went again.</l>

                     <l>Upon what weighty bus'neſs you are here,</l>
                     <l>When others ſleep, and at a time undue.</l>
                     <l>Meant you to rifle any of the dead?</l>
                     <l>Or were you ſent by <hi>Hector</hi> as a Spy,</l>
                     <l>Or undertook the ſame of your own Head?</l>
                     <l>T'<hi>Ulyſſes Dolon</hi> then did thus reply.</l>
                     <l>I was by <hi>Hector</hi>'s promiſes ſet on,</l>
                     <l>And ſhould have had <hi>Achilles</hi> Chariot</l>
                     <l>And Horſes, if I to the Fleet had gone,</l>
                     <l>And good intelligence to <hi>Hector</hi> brought</l>
                     <l>Whether the Ships be guarded as before,</l>
                     <l>Or that the <hi>Greeks</hi> now beaten mean to fly,</l>
                     <l>And weary of their labour watch no more.</l>
                     <l>To this again <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> made reply,</l>

                     <l>And ſmiling ſaid, It was no ſmall reward</l>
                     <l>You aimed at. <hi>Achilles</hi> Horſes ſay ye?</l>
                     <l>To rule them for a mortal man 'tis hard.</l>
                     <l>The Goddeſs <hi>Thetis</hi> Son they'll ſcarce obey.</l>
                     <l>But tell me further; When you came away</l>
                     <l>Where you left <hi>Hector,</hi> where his Horſes are,</l>
                     <l>And where his Arms, where other <hi>Trojans</hi> ſtay</l>

                     <l>Alwaies ſo near our Ships as they-are now.</l>
                     <l>T'<hi>Ulyſſes Dolon</hi> then again reply'd,</l>
                     <l>This alſo I will let you truly know.</l>
                     <l>I <hi>Hector</hi> left at <hi>Ibus</hi> Sepulcher</l>

                     <l>The reſt about the Bonfires waking were.</l>
                     <l>But certain Watch appointed there was none.</l>
                     <l>But thoſe Confederates that came from far</l>
                     <l>Slept at their eaſe all night and watched not.</l>
                     <l>For that they truſted to the <hi>Trojans</hi> care,</l>
                     <l>Having no Wives nor Children with them brought.</l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> then examin'd him again,</l>
                     <l>How lye the Strangers? Mixt with thoſe of <hi>Troy</hi>

                     <l>Or by themſelves? Inform me and be plain.</l>
                     <l>Nothing (ſaid <hi>Dolon</hi>) but the truth I'll ſay.</l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Paeons, Pelaſgians, Caucons, Leleges,</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>And <hi>Cars</hi> lye by the Sea-ſide on the Sands,</l>
                     <l>The reſt near <hi>Thymbra</hi> quarter, and are theſe;</l>
                     <l>The <hi>Maeons, Myſians, Lycians, Phrygians.</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>But there's no need to tell you ev'ry thing;</l>
                     <l>For if upon our Quarters you would fall,</l>
                     <l>There lye the <hi>Thracians</hi> new come, and their King</l>
                     <l>

                     <l>Such Horſes yet I never did behold,</l>
                     <l>Swift as the Wind, and than the Snow more white,</l>
                     <l>With silver cover'd is his Charre, and Gold;</l>
                     <l>Gold are his Arms and make a gallant ſight,</l>
                     <l>And fitter for a God than man to wear.</l>
                     <l>But try now whether I ſay true or no,</l>
                     <l>And ſend me to the Ships, or bind me here.</l>
                     <l>Then ſaid <hi>Tydides</hi> with a frowning Brow,</l>

                     <l>Think not to ſcape though all you ſay be true.</l>

                     <l>You may return agen to Fight or View;</l>
                     <l>But hurt us cannot if I kill you now.</l>
                     <l>As <hi>Dolon</hi> then beginning was to pray</l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Tydides</hi> ſword lighted on's Neck ſo juſt,</l>

                     <l>And from him then they took his Cap of Cat,</l>
                     <l>His Spear and Wolfes-ſkin Coat, and Bow unbent,</l>
                     <l>And in his hands <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> took all that,</l>
                     <l>And to <hi>Minerva</hi> up his Prayer ſent.</l>
                     <l>Hail <hi>Pallas,</hi> whom we pray'd to for ſucceſs</l>

                     <l>To find them coming back becauſe 'twas dark.</l>
                     <l>Then with <hi>Tydides</hi> onward he proceeds,</l>
                     <l>And ev'ry ſtep on Arms or Blood they tread</l>
                     <l>And ſoon amongſt the <hi>Thracians</hi> they were,</l>

                     <l>Their Horſes to the Charret-ſeats were ty'd.</l>
                     <l>Thus in three Rows the <hi>Thracians</hi> were laid,</l>

                     <l>Before both Gods and Men to hold her light,</l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Eris</hi> from <hi>Jove</hi> the Signal carried</l>
                     <l>Unto the <hi>Argive</hi> Fleet of bloudy Fight.</l>
                     <l>And down unto <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> Ship ſhe went</l>
                     <l>That was the middlemoſt and high'ſt of all</l>
                     <l>That heard ſhe might be to <hi>Achilles</hi> Tent,</l>
                     <l>And <hi>Ajaxes,</hi> that they might hear her call.</l>
                     <l>At th' outſides of the Fleet they quarter'd were;</l>
                     <l>For they upon their Proweſs moſt reli'd:</l>
                     <l>Then <hi>Eris</hi> with her voice the Air did tear,</l>
                     <l>And horribly to the <hi>Achaeans</hi> cri'd.</l>
                     <l>Come quickly forth into the Field and fight;</l>
                     <l>Be bold <hi>Achaeans;</hi> to the Battle come.</l>
                     <l>Incourag'd thus the <hi>Greeks</hi> took more delight</l>
                     <l>In ſtaying at the War than going home.</l>
                     <l>Fellows, to Arms, then <hi>Agamemnon</hi> cri'd,</l>
                     <l>And to put on his Arms the firſt man was;</l>
                     <l>His Leg-pieces he down to th' Anckles ti'd</l>
                     <l>With ſilver Buckles, Leg-pieces of Braſs;</l>
                     <l>And then puts on an Armour on his breaſt,</l>
                     <l>That had been given him by <hi>Cinyres</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>(His antient acquaintance and his Gueſt)</l>
                     <l>Whilſt he preparing was to paſs the Seas:</l>
                     <l>For long before the <hi>Greeks</hi> for <hi>Troy</hi> ſet ſail,</l>
                     <l>Their purpoſe was at <hi>Cyprus</hi> known by fame,</l>
                     <l>And thinking ſuch a Gift might him avail,</l>
                     <l>In kindneſs t'<hi>Agamemnon</hi> ſent the ſame.</l>
                     <l>The colour was by Pales diſtinguiſhed,</l>
                     <l>Ten Black, twelve Gold, and twenty were of Tin:</l>
                     <l>And in it three black Serpents figured</l>
                     <l>As if they creeping were unto his Chin.</l>

                     <l>Their ſides like Rainbows lookt which in the Sky</l>
                     <l>Are ſhewn by <hi>Jove</hi> for men to wonder at.</l>
                     <l>Then from his ſhoulder down upon his thigh</l>
                     <l>He hung his Sword. Studded with Gold was that,</l>
                     <l>Then took his Shield which finely varied was</l>
                     <l>Boſſed in twenty places with white Tin;</l>
                     <l>And round about them were ten Orbs of Braſs;</l>
                     <l>And black the Circle was enclos'd within.</l>
                     <l>There <hi>Gorgo</hi> painted was with killing Eyes,</l>
                     <l>And with her ſtanding Terror and Affright:</l>
                     <l>His Belt of ſilver was, and to the Skyes</l>
                     <l>Returned back agen the glittering light.</l>
                     <l>Wound up lay on it painted a great Snake,</l>
                     <l>Which had three heads, and crowned was each one,</l>
                     <l>And laſt into his hand two Spears did take,</l>
                     <l>Having his Helmet on his head put on.</l>
                     <l>Thus <hi>Agamemnon</hi> armed was. And then</l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Juno</hi> and <hi>Pallas</hi> both rais'd ſuch a ſound</l>
                     <l>(To honour him before the <hi>Greeks</hi>) as when</l>

                     <l>Then every one unto his Chariotier</l>
                     <l>Commandment gave upon the Ditch to ſtay</l>
                     <l>And ready be. The foot all armed were,</l>
                     <l>And forth into the Field were march'd away.</l>
                     <l>But ſoon again the Horſes with them ſtood.</l>
                     <l>Then <hi>Jove</hi> amongſt them Noiſe and Tumult ſent;</l>
                     <l>And mingled was the Morning dew with Bloud,</l>
                     <l>For on that day much bloud was to be ſpent.</l>
                     <l>Upon a riſing ground now <hi>Hector</hi> was,</l>

                     <l>In number equal; and gave great delight</l>

                     <l>And by himſelf he from them went; and then</l>
                     <l>Took pride to ſee the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Trojans</hi> fight,</l>

                     <l>And great the ſlaughter was of them that fled,</l>

                     <l>For they that drave them faln were in the Battle,</l>

                     <l>Who ſwiftly ran fearing to come too late.</l>

                     <l>In one ſcale Wooll, in th'other Weight puts in</l>

                     <l>Till <hi>Hector</hi> came, to whom <hi>Jove</hi> chiefly meant</l>
                     <l>To give the honour of the Victory.</l>
                     <l>Then <hi>Hector</hi> up the Wall the formoſt went,</l>
                     <l>And thence unto his <hi>Trojans</hi> loud did cry,</l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Trojans</hi> come on, and break me down this Wall,</l>

                     <l>This ſaid, he he heard was by the <hi>Trojans</hi> all,</l>
                     <l>And ſtreight unto the Battlements they came.</l>
                     <l>Then <hi>Hector</hi> at the Gate took up a ſtone</l>
                     <l>Great and ſharp-pointed; two men ſuch as now</l>
                     <l>Could ſcarce have lifted up ſo great a one:</l>
                     <l>But <hi>Hector</hi> with one hand the ſame could throw;</l>

                     <l>And as unto a Shepherd is a Fleece</l>
                     <l>Of Wooll, that to be born needs little might;</l>
                     <l>So eas'ly born the ſtone by <hi>Hector</hi> is;</l>
                     <l>And ſtanding at the Gate well fortifi'd</l>

                     <l>Out flew the ſtone and at the Gate went in.</l>
                     <l>The Gate then roar'd; the Hinges broken were;</l>
                     <l>The Bars upon the ground aſunder lay;</l>

                     <l>And to the Ships now open was the way.</l>
                     <l>And <hi>Hector</hi> with a countenance like night</l>
                     <l>Flew in. And fire appeared in his eyes:</l>
                     <l>His Armour as he marched ſhined bright,</l>
                     <l>And light reflected up unto the Skies;</l>

                     <l>For none except a God could him reſiſt.</l>

                     <l>You are too fierce. A fight between the Gods</l>

                     <l>Nor does it need; ſo much we have the ods.</l>
                     <l>But let's go hence to yonder Mountain top,</l>
                     <l>And leave the Battle in the hands of men.</l>

                     <l>We to the Battle will return agen,</l>
                     <l>And ſend them to <hi>Olympus</hi> home with ſhame,</l>

                     <l>And when he come was to the Caſtle-wall,</l>

                     <l>He whips himſelf int' anger with his Tail,</l>
                     <l>And terribly goes on, and yawns and foams,</l>
                     <l>To kill, or to be killed if he ſail:</l>
                     <l>So at the ſeeing of <hi>Aeneas</hi> Spear,</l>

                     <l>Their hoofs, which very wondrous was to ſee.</l>

                     <l>Though Heav'nly Arms to mortals will not yield,</l>
                     <l>But that he thought not on. Nor did the Spear</l>
                     <l>Well driven as it was and ſtrong, paſs through.</l>
                     <l>For of five plies that labour'd in it were</l>
                     <l>By <hi>Mulciber,</hi> it pierced only two,</l>

                     <l>But coming to the Gold it there ſtuck in.</l>
                     <l>And then <hi>Achilles</hi> threw his Spear at him,</l>

                     <l>WHen to the River <hi>Xanthus</hi> they were come,</l>
                     <l>The <hi>Trojans</hi> at the Ford half of them paſs'd,</l>
                     <l>And on the High way fled to <hi>Ilium;</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>The other leapt into the Stream for haſte,</l>
                     <l>And with the winding flood there ſwimming ſtrive.</l>
                     <l>As Locuſts when by ſudden Tier ſprung</l>
                     <l>In ſwarms unto the River fly and dive;</l>
                     <l>So they themſelves into <hi>Scamander</hi> flung.</l>
                     <l>And filled was the Stream with Horſe and Men.</l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Achilles</hi> on the Bank-ſide leſt his Spear</l>
                     <l>Set up on end againſt a Tree; and then</l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Achilles</hi> leapt in with his Sword; and there</l>
                     <l>He kill'd as faſt as he could turn and ſtrike,</l>
                     <l>And with their bloud the Stream was dyed red.</l>
                     <l>And grievous 'twas to hear them groan and ſarike,</l>
                     <l>That in the flood were by him maſſacred.</l>
                     <l>As when the Dolphins in a River are,</l>
                     <l>The other Fiſh ſcud to the Banks in ſholes,</l>
                     <l>So did it with the ſwimming <hi>Trojans</hi> fare,</l>
                     <l>They fled to th'Banks and hid themſelves in holes.</l>
                     <l>And twelve of them alive <hi>Achilles</hi> took,</l>
                     <l>And with their Girdles hands behind them bound,</l>
                     <l>Then eaus'd them to be led out of the Brook.</l>
                     <l>And to the Ships conveyed ſafe and ſound;</l>
                     <l>To ſlay them at <hi>Patroclus</hi> Funeral.</l>
                     <l>Then from the River out he came again,</l>
                     <l>And <hi>Priam</hi>'s Son <hi>Lycaon</hi> met withal</l>
                     <l>That from <hi>Scamander</hi> flying was in vain.</l>
                     <l>Whom Priſoner he had taken once before,</l>
                     <l>When in his Father's ground he was by night</l>
                     <l>Cutting of Spoak ſtaves from a Sycamore,</l>
                     <l>And on him now the ſecond time did light.</l>

                     <l>To <hi>Lemnos</hi> firſt he ſent him to be ſold,</l>
                     <l>And bought he there was by <hi>Eetion.</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Achilles</hi> for him had good ſtore of Gold.</l>
                     <l>But he got looſe and home again did run.</l>
                     <l>And there eleven days he ſtaid; and well</l>
                     <l>Was entertained in his Father's houſe.</l>
                     <l>The twelfth into <hi>Achilles</hi> hands he fell</l>
                     <l>Agen, that ſent him then to <hi>Erebus.</hi>

                     <l>
                        <hi>Achilles</hi> ſeeing him without a Spear,</l>
                     <l>Without a Shield, and nothing on his head</l>
                     <l>(For he had caſt away his Arms for fear</l>

                     <l>
                        <hi>Achilles</hi> grumbling to himſelf then ſaid,</l>
                     <l>O ſtrange! Theſe <hi>Trojans</hi> are ſtout-hearted men,</l>
                     <l>That being ſent away, will not be ſtaid,</l>
                     <l>But to the War muſt needs come back agen.</l>
                     <l>Here's one I ſent to <hi>Lemnos</hi> to be ſold,</l>
                     <l>And now is come to fight with me agen.</l>
                     <l>'Tis ſtrange the Sea could not him from me hold,</l>
                     <l>That can againſt their wills hold other men.</l>
                     <l>But well, I'll give him of my Spear a taſt,</l>
                     <l>And ſend him to the Earth, that I may ſee</l>
                     <l>Whether the Earth or no can hold him faſt,</l>
                     <l>By which are holden better men than he.</l>
                     <l>Whilſt this <hi>Achilles</hi> ſaid, the man came near,</l>
                     <l>To beg his life; for loath to die was he.</l>
                     <l>To wound him then <hi>Achilles</hi> lifts his Spear.</l>
                     <l>But under it he got unto his knee,</l>
                     <l>And with one hand laid hold upon his Spear,</l>
                     <l>And on <hi>Achilles</hi> knee the other laid.</l>
                     <l>And kneeling down before him ſhook with fear,</l>
                     <l>And lamentably to him ſpeaking ſaid,</l>

                     <l>That I your Pris'ner was. Captivitie</l>
                     <l>At leaſt for life a Sanctuary is.</l>
                     <l>And when you unto <hi>Lemnos</hi> ſent me had,</l>
                     <l>You for me got a hundred Oxens price.</l>
                     <l>And for my Ranſom now I ſhould be glad</l>

                     <l>Which on his leg below the knee did light,</l>

After, he proceeded on his Journey to <hi>Cuma,</hi> and when be came there he was well received, and he had ſome friends in the Senate that did propoſe to have had a maintainance ſettled on him for his life, but it could not be carried. At this place he firſt received the name of <hi>Homer,</hi> from his <hi>Blindneſs.</hi> From <hi>Cuma</hi> he went to <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caea,</hi> where lived one <hi>Theſtorides</hi> a School ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, who invited <hi>Homer</hi> to live with him; and by that means he got ſome of his Verſes, and after went to <hi>Chios,</hi> where he taught them as his own Verſes, and got great reputation by them. When <hi>Homer</hi> heard that <hi>Theſtorides</hi> bad thus abuſed him, he followed him to <hi>Chios,</hi> and by the way at a place called <hi>Bolliſus</hi> was taken up by a Shepherd as he was keeping his Maſters Sheep: the Shepherd did relieve him, and carried him to his Maſter, where he lived ſometime, and he taught his Children, yet he could not reſt till he had been at <hi>Chios</hi> to diſcover the Cheat of <hi>Theſtorides,</hi> who when he heard of <hi>Homer</hi>'s coming, be left <hi>Chios,</hi>

From <hi>Samus</hi> he was going to <hi>Athens,</hi> but fell ſick at <hi>IOS,</hi> and there died, and was buried on the Sea-ſhore.

                     <l>At this diſcourſe in Heaven was <hi>Hermes</hi> by,</l>

                     <l>Many things are there wherein one delights,</l>
                     <l>Which to another man unpleaſant be.</l>
                     <l>Before the <hi>Greeks</hi> went to the Siege of <hi>Troy</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>Nine times had I commanded on the Seas,</l>
                     <l>And always our Succeſs was good that way,</l>
                     <l>And of the Prey I choſe what did me pleaſe</l>
                     <l>Beſide my ſhare. And wealth came in apace.</l>
                     <l>Wiſe I was thought, and honour'd much in <hi>Crete.</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>And when <hi>Jove</hi> had decreed <hi>Troy</hi> to deface,</l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Idomeneus</hi> and I went with the Fleet,</l>
                     <l>Or elſe we muſt our credit quite have loſt.</l>
                     <l>Nine years we fought, the tenth we took the Town.</l>
                     <l>And ſetting up our Sails we left the Coaſt,</l>
                     <l>And by the Gods were toſſed up and down.</l>
                     <l>But <hi>Jove</hi> determin'd me more trouble yet.</l>
                     <l>For needs I would to <hi>Aegypt</hi> go and trade.</l>
                     <l>A month I ſtaid at home, then forth I ſet</l>
                     <l>With nine good ſhips, and an ill Voyage made.</l>
                     <l>For when ſix days I feaſted had my Crew,</l>
                     <l>And to the Gods devoutly offer'd part;</l>
                     <l>A good ſtrong wind from the North Heaven blew,</l>
                     <l>And from the Coaſt of <hi>Crete</hi> we then depart.</l>
                     <l>Smoothly we ſail'd, ſafe our arrival was,</l>
                     <l>Nor man nor ſhip had any harm at all.</l>
                     <l>From ſhore to ſhore we did in five days paſs,</l>
                     <l>And in the <hi>Nile</hi> we let our anchors fall.</l>
                     <l>Then I my Fellows bad aboard to ſtay</l>
                     <l>And guard the ſhips, and ſome to places high</l>
                     <l>I ſent to watch, but mov'd by lucre, they</l>
                     <l>On plunder and on rapine had their eye.</l>
                     <l>The fields they waſte, and kill the men, and make</l>
                     <l>Women and Children captives. Then the cry</l>
                     <l>Arriving at the City, Arms they take,</l>
                     <l>And next day carly to the field they hie,</l>

                     <l>VVith Horſe and Foot then thundered the field.</l>
                     <l>Their Armour lightned. My men frighted were.</l>
                     <l>Some taken and made ſlaves; ſome flying kill'd;</l>
                     <l>And all the reſt ran ſcatter'd here and there.</l>
                     <l>Then I (though t'had been better there t'have di'd,</l>
                     <l>So many woes have ſince befallen me)</l>

                     <l>And Buckler too, and kneel'd at the Kings knee.</l>
                     <l>He reſcu'd me, and home with him me brought,</l>
                     <l>Sitting by him that did his Chariot drive.</l>
                     <l>Though in their heat many to kill me ſought,</l>
                     <l>Yet the King brought me to the Town alive.</l>
                     <l>Seven years I there remain'd and riches got.</l>
                     <l>For every man almoſt me ſomewhat gave.</l>
                     <l>Then thither came a Merchant that had not</l>

                     <l>And he with Lyes entic'd me to his home;</l>
                     <l>VVith him I went. And there I ſtaid a year.</l>
                     <l>And when the Months and Days about were come,</l>
                     <l>He ſet me in a Ship for <hi>Libya;</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>And there together with our Goods we ſate,</l>

                     </l>
                     <l>For by good luck we had a wind full North.</l>
                     <l>But <hi>Jove</hi> determin'd had we ſhould not ſee't.</l>
                     <l>For when the Iſland we had left behind,</l>

                     <l>
                        <hi>Jove</hi> fetcht the Clouds together with a VVind</l>

                     <l>I not believe a word. What needed you,</l>
                     <l>So wiſe a man as you appear to me,</l>

                     <l>For all the Gods have ſhewn themſelves his foes,</l>

                     <l>If not, and that I told you prove untrue,</l>
                     <l>Then make your Servants throw me from a Cliff</l>
                     <l>High and upright, That others may beware</l>

                     <l>Of things they know not, but uncertain are.</l>
                     <l>Then ſaid <hi>Eumaeus,</hi> Yes, 'twere a fine deed,</l>

                     <l>And with great noiſe they pent are in the ſties.</l>

                     <l>Sitting or creeping, and obſerves theſe Wooers,</l>
                     <l>What evil deeds they do. And he the while</l>

                     <l>I ſaw the ſame at Sea by Augury,</l>

                     <l>While they together thus within diſcourſe,</l>
                     <l>The Suiters were gone out to throw the Stone,</l>

                     <l>As they at other times before had done.</l>
                     <l>Now Supper-time drew near. Sheep home were brought.</l>
                     <l>From ev'ry field. Then <hi>Medon</hi> to them ſpake,</l>

                     <l>Agreed they were; none thought the motion ill.</l>
                     <l>They then into the Hall went every one.</l>

                     <l>On Couches and on Chairs their Cloaks they throw.</l>

                     <l>And franked Swine, and from the Herd a Cow.</l>
                     <l>Mean while <hi>Eumaeus</hi> to the City hies,</l>

                     <l>The man to ſee to was both great and tall,</l>
                     <l>Though but a lither ſellow. Down he ſate</l>
                     <l>Boldly within the Porch before the Hall.</l>
                     <l>He had a greedy gut, and named was</l>

                     <l>I do not envy you the meat which they</l>

                     <l>Envy not other men; I think you are</l>
                     <l>As well as I a Beggar; but forbear</l>
                     <l>To threaten me too much. You're beſt beware,</l>

                     <l>And breaſt with blood, and ſo have better room.</l>

                     <l>Thou never wilt be able more to come.</l>
                     <l>This made the Beggar more impatient,</l>
                     <l>O (ſays he) how the Raſkal prates! 'Twere well</l>

                     <l>There are o'th' fire good padding full of ſuit,</l>

                     <l>But ſhew'd his ſhoulders wide, &amp; his ſtrong thighs.</l>
                     <l>His large breaſt and his brawny arms appear.</l>

                     <l>And <hi>Irus</hi> then was mightily afraid.</l>
                     <l>But yet by force the Servants brought him out,</l>
                     <l>His fleſh ſtill trembling on his limbs with fear,</l>
                     <l>Shew not thy ſelf a Coward and a Lout;</l>
                     <l>Nor fear a man worn out with many a year.</l>
                     <l>For if he get the better, thou ſhalt go</l>
                     <l>Unto King <hi>Takim,</hi> and there by his Law</l>

                     <l>This made him quake more yet. Into the liſts</l>
                     <l>They brought him ſo. Both ready were to fight.</l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> then thought how to uſe his fiſts,</l>
                     <l>Whether to beat him down or kill him quite.</l>
                     <l>But not t'offend the Suiters thought it beſt</l>
                     <l>To ſtrike him gently. And when they were near</l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Irus</hi> did hit <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> on the breaſt.</l>

                     <l>He broke the bones, at's mouth the blood guſht out.</l>
                     <l>He fell, ſqueakt, ſhed his teeth. The Suiters were</l>
                     <l>With laughter almoſt dead, that ſtood about.</l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> drag'd him to the utter-gate,</l>
                     <l>And ſet him to the hedge, as 'twere a Signe,</l>

                     <l>By which his Scrip hung rag'd and full of holes.</l>
                     <l>Then ſat him down i'th' Porch. The Suiters enter</l>
                     <l>All laughing in, and as they paſſed by</l>
                     <l>Greatly congratulated his adventure.</l>

                     <l>What is your Name, and who your Parents be,</l>
                     <l>And further tell me where your Country is.</l>
                     <l>When ſhe had ſaid, <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> thus replies,</l>
                     <l>O Queen, through all the world your praiſes ring,</l>
                     <l>Your vertues known are up unto the Skies,</l>
                     <l>No leſs than of ſome great and happy King,</l>
                     <l>That maintains Juſtice, and whoſe fertile ground</l>
                     <l>Bears ſtore of Wheat and Barley, and whoſe Trees</l>
                     <l>Are charg'd with Fruit, and all his ſheep ſtand ſound,</l>
                     <l>And under him a valiant people ſees.</l>
                     <l>And therefore aſk me what you will beſide.</l>
                     <l>My Kin and Country to my ſelf I'd keep.</l>
                     <l>For then my grief I can no longer hide,</l>
                     <l>Or think thereon, but ready am to weep.</l>
                     <l>Which here would be no ſeemly thing to do.</l>
                     <l>For why, your Maids might peradventure think,</l>
                     <l>And you your ſelf, it may be, think ſo too,</l>
                     <l>My tears came not from ſorrow but from drink.</l>
                     <l>Stranger (ſaid ſhe) my Beauty, Form, and Worth</l>
                     <l>Th' Immortal Gods took from me then away</l>
                     <l>When firſt <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> with the <hi>Greeks</hi> went forth</l>
                     <l>To that abominable Town of <hi>Troy.</hi>
                     </l>

                     <l>But were he here, that had the care of me,</l>
                     <l>I ſhould more honour have, and beauty ſo.</l>
                     <l>But now I lead my life in miſery.</l>
                     <l>The Gods upon me troubles daily throw.</l>
                     <l>For all the Lords that in theſe Iſlands be,</l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Same, Dulichium,</hi> and woody <hi>Zant,</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>And <hi>Ithaca</hi> it ſelf, Suiters to me,</l>
                     <l>My houſe continually together haunt.</l>
                     <l>And there devour my Cattle, Corn and Wine,</l>
                     <l>So that of Strangers I can take no care,</l>
                     <l>Nor can my ſelf diſpoſe of what is mine,</l>
                     <l>Nor Meſſengers receive that publike are.</l>
                     <l>But longing for my Huſband fit and pine.</l>
                     <l>They preſs for Marriage, I to put it by.</l>
                     <l>Then came into my thought (ſome Power divine</l>
                     <l>Sure prompt me) to ſet up a Beam. So I</l>
                     <l>A Beam ſet up, and then began to weave.</l>
                     <l>Suiters (ſaid I) ſince dead <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> is,</l>
                     <l>Stay yet a little while and give me leave</l>
                     <l>To make an end but of one buſineſs.</l>
                     <l>I muſt for old <hi>Laertes</hi> make a Cloth,</l>
                     <l>Which in his Sepulchre he is to wear.</l>
                     <l>T'offend the Wives of <hi>Greece</hi> I ſhould be loath.</l>
                     <l>For to accuſe me they will not forbear.</l>
                     <l>They'll ſay I very haſty was to wed,</l>
                     <l>If I go hence and not provide a ſhroud</l>
                     <l>Wherein <hi>Laertes</hi> muſt be buried,</l>
                     <l>Out of his wealth. That might have been allow'd.</l>
                     <l>My Suiters all were well content. And then</l>
                     <l>All day I wove; but ere I went to bed,</l>
                     <l>What I had wov'n I ravel'd out agen.</l>
                     <l>Three years my Suiters I thus fruſtrated.</l>
                     <l>In the fourth year my women me betrai'd;</l>
                     <l>And in they came while I the Web undid;</l>
                     <l>I could the wedding now no more avoid,</l>
                     <l>But I was rated by them much and chid.</l>
                     <l>What I am next to do I cannot tell;</l>
                     <l>My Father and my Mother bid me marry;</l>
                     <l>My Son is weary, and takes not very well</l>
                     <l>That th'Woo'rs devouring him ſhould longer tarry.</l>

                     <l>Upon the Publike Charge himſelf and men.</l>
                     <l>Twelve days the wind continued at North,</l>

                     <l>'Twas ſo like truth, ſhe wept. As when the Sun</l>

                     <l>Innumerable ſtreams of water run,</l>
                     <l>And the low Rivers of the Valley fill:</l>

                     <l>As hard as horn or iron was his eye,</l>
                     <l>And by deſign himſelf from tears he kept.</l>
                     <l>After with weeping ſhe was ſatisfi'd,</l>
                     <l>Stranger, ſaid ſhe, I'll aſk you ſomewhat now</l>
                     <l>By which moſt certainly it will be tri'd,</l>
                     <l>If you my Huſband as you ſay did know</l>
                     <l>Or entertain'd him, and his company.</l>
                     <l>What kind of perſon was he, and how clad?</l>
                     <l>How ſerv'd? To this <hi>Ulyſses</hi> made reply.</l>
                     <l>Though twenty year ago it be, and bad</l>
                     <l>My Memory; yet what I can recal,</l>
                     <l>I will relate. He wore a Purple Veſt</l>
                     <l>Unſhorn, and lin'd. Before embroider'd all.</l>
                     <l>Two claſps of Gold. And in it was expreſt.</l>
                     <l>A Hound that did between his foreſeet hold</l>
                     <l>A Fawn that ſprall'd and labour'd to get free.</l>
                     <l>Which was ſo lively done, and all in Gold</l>
                     <l>Performed was, that wonder 'twas to ſee.</l>
                     <l>His Coat (I markt) ſo ſoft it was and fine</l>
                     <l>As is the fold of a dry Onion,</l>
                     <l>And as the Sun, did gloriouſly ſhine,</l>
                     <l>And women gaz'd upon him many a one,</l>
                     <l>Such were his Garments, but I know not whence</l>
                     <l>He had them. You know better that than I;</l>
                     <l>VVhether he ſo appareli'd went from hence,</l>
                     <l>Preſented by ſome of his Company,</l>
                     <l>Or given to him ſomewhere by ſome Gueſt.</l>
                     <l>For he was much beloved far and near,</l>
                     <l>And of th'<hi>Achaeans</hi> all eſteem'd the beſt,</l>
                     <l>Amongſt the <hi>Greeks</hi> he hardly had his Peer.</l>
                     <l>And I him gave a Purple double Veſt,</l>
                     <l>A Sword and Coat edged with fringes trim,</l>
                     <l>And brought him to his Ship. Amongſt the reſt</l>
                     <l>A Herald was; and I'll deſcribe you him.</l>

                     <l>Round ſhoulder'd was he, curled was his hair,</l>

                     <l>
                        <hi>Ulyſses</hi> to him much reſpect did bear,</l>

                     <l>But wept again, and ſorer than before;</l>
                     <l>For ſhe found true the tokens he had told.</l>
                     <l>But when this ſhow'r of tears was paſſed o're,</l>
                     <l>Stranger (ſaid ſhe) I piti'd you before;</l>
                     <l>Now as a friend you ſhall reſpected be.</l>
                     <l>'Twas I gave him th'Apparel he then wore</l>

                     <l>But I ſhall never ſee him more at home;</l>
                     <l>In an unlucky hour he croſs'd the Main</l>

                     </l>
                     <l>Then thus <hi>Ulyſses</hi> anſwer'd her again:</l>

                     <l>
                        <hi>Antinous</hi> gave him language very bad.</l>

                     <l>That of our Feaſt thou haſt an equal part,</l>

                     <l>'Tis wine that makes thee not thy ſelf to know.</l>
                     <l>For wine ſerves all men ſo that drink too much.</l>
                     <l>Wine hurt <hi>Burytion</hi> the Centaur great.</l>

                     <l>A way the cauſe of his own harm he bears.</l>
                     <l>From that day on, Centaurs and men are foes.</l>

                     <l>I ſaw where th'wound was giv'n him by the Swine;</l>
                     <l>And had then told you had he thought it meet.</l>

                     <l>If it be falſe put me to cruel death.</l>
                     <l>To this <hi>Penelope</hi> did then reply,</l>
                     <l>The purpoſe of the Gods, wire though you be,</l>
                     <l>You know not, Nurſe. But I'll go to my Son,</l>
                     <l>And there upon the place with him I'll ſee</l>
                     <l>What men are ſlain, and who the deed has done.</l>
                     <l>Then down ſhe went conſulting in her breaſt,</l>
                     <l>Whether at diſtance it were beſt to try,</l>
                     <l>Or elſe directly go unto the Gueſt,</l>
                     <l>And there receive and kiſs him preſently.</l>
                     <l>But when into the Hall ſhe entred was,</l>

                     <l>As one that's in a trance, and has no thought:</l>
                     <l>But by and by ſurveying him ſhe thought</l>

                     <l>Her mind was chang'd. She thought that he 'twas not.</l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Telemachus</hi> his Mother chid, and ſaid,</l>

                     <l>The cauſe why now ſo little ſhe ſets by me,</l>

                     <l>Father (ſaid he) let that be your own care.</l>
